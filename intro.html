        <h3>2nd year undergraduate studying Computer Science at The University of Warwick, passionate about building software and solving problems</h3>
        <p>My interest in computers started when I self-taught computer science GCSE. This involved learning to program in Python, which I found to be an enjoyable challenge. Whilst at school 
            I was fortunate to complete work experience at Arm which allowed me to see the scale of the impact that the computing industry has on the world. I continued experimenting with programming 
            in different languages and eventually started studying Computer Science more formally at A-Level and now as a degree. I am excited to start a career putting the skills I have learned to good use.
