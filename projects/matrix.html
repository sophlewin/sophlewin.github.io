        <p> Written in C#, using Windows Forms to process and display graphics. <br>
			Draws shapes from their coordinates in 2D or 3D and applies matrix transformations to the coordinates to scale/rotate/translate the shapes. <br>
			When shapes are transformed using keyboard controls, the transformation matrix being used is displayed to the user, allowing the program to be used as a teaching tool. <br>
			Shapes can be generated based on specified properties (2D/3D, number of vertices) and stored as text/csv files using either adjacency list or adjacency matrix formats. <br>
			There is also a database of common shapes, which can be searched for shapes with specific properties via SQL. <br> </p>
