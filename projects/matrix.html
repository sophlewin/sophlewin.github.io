        <p> Written in C#, using Windows Forms to process and display graphics. <br>
			Draws shapes from their co-ordinates in 2D or 3D and applies matrix transformations to the coordinates to scale/rotate/translate the shapes. <br>
			Shapes can be generated based on specified properties (2D/3D, number of vertices) and stored as text/csv files using either adjacency list or adjacency matrix formats. <br>
			There is also a database of common shapes, which can be searched for shapes with specific properties via SQL. <br> </p>
